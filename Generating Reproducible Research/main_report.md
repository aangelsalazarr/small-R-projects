US & Global Energy Forecast Data
================

#### **Energy**

##### The purpose of this report is to use publicly available data from the Energy

##### Information Administration (EIA) in order to think about the following questions:

1.  Within a U.S. context, what do we expect energy to look like up
    until 2050?
2.  Within a U.S. context, where is Renewable Energy headed?
3.  Within a global context, what will energy and emissions look like
    thinking forward to 2050?

##### Before moving forward, it should be acknowledged that the data analyzed in this

##### report falls under the EIA 2020 Reference Case. This reference case maintains

##### very minimal volatility and variation in terms of energy related growth and

##### development. Overall, said data is also based on current energy policy within

##### the United States. There are many more scenarios/cases but for the sake of

##### wordcount and codelines, this report limits its analyzatin to only the described

##### reference case in order to explore how energy is set to change moving forward.

#### **US Consumption vs Production Forecasts**

##### The figure below demonstrates EIA Reference case forecasts on energy consumption

##### and production from 2020 to 2050. One observation from the data is that

##### renewable energy is set to grow by roughly 200% from 2020 to 2050. While that is

##### a positive observation as it relates to how energy consumption and production is

##### made up, it can be observed that both \[natural gas\] and \[liquid fuels\] are set to

##### make up the majority of energy consumption up until 2050.

#### **US Export vs Import Forecasts**

##### Petroleum Exports are expected to peak around 2026 and then steadily decline by

##### 2050\. Natural Gas Exports on the other hand are expexcted to steadily rise while

#### Coal exports are expected to decline very slowly to 2050.

#### In terms of imports, Crude Oil is expected to, on average, increase in terms of imports by 2050. All other fuel types are expected to decline.

#### Looking at export/import data forecasts for the US, it can be assumed that overall,

#### US current energy policy will be successfull in leading to a decline of trade with

#### non-renewable fuels, although the decline will be very slow. Overall, up until 2050,

#### trade of fossil fuels is expected to reman relatively high.

#### **US Energy Prices Forecasts**

##### Lookinga the the included figure, both BRENT CRUDE and WTI CRUDE are expected to

##### peak real prices by 2050. Said indexes are expected to reach the $90+ range.

##### Referring back to the US energy production graph, this makes sense given there is

##### set to to be a very small decrease in Liquid Fuels Production moving forward.

##### Moreover, one must acknowlege the global market when taking into consideration

##### energy prices. It is expected that many nations will phase out fossil fuels

##### moving forward. This can be expected to drive up oil prices moving forward.

##### What is interesting is that electricity prices are set to slightly decrease

##### moving forward until 2050.

#### **US Emissions Forecasts**

##### Emissions related to Petroleum and Natural Gas are expected to rise in the US

##### up until 2050. On the other hand, coal is set to slowly decline from approximatley

##### 880 MMmt of CO2 to roughly below 650 MMmt of CO2 in 2050. This expected decline

##### alongside the aforementioned Fuel Type emissions increases seem to indicate an

##### overall decrease of US emissions.

#### **US Renewable Energy Forecasts**

##### The data in this figure indicates that Solar and Wind energy technologies

##### are set to grow exponentially over the next few decades. For example, as it

##### relates to Solar PV technology, there is an expected 300 Gw increase from

#### 2020 to 2050. That is roughly a %600 increase from 2020 levels.

#### **Global Energy and Emissions Forecast**

##### As expected, non-OECD countries are expected to grow at an alarming rate

##### in terms of how much energy is consumed. This can be assume to be partially

##### due to economic development and population growth. OECD energy use is expected

##### to remain under 300 quads Btu in 2050, whereas non-OECD energy use is expected

##### to reach above 600 quads Btu, essentially double the energy use of OECD countries.

##### It can be observed from the World Carbon Emissions graph below that non-OECD

##### Asian countries are expected to make up the majority of carbon emissions by 2050.

##### OECD countries are essentially projected to remain in slow decline by 2050.

#### **Conclusion**

##### In conclusion, the above data presents a pretty unexciting trend of energy

##### moving forward. Interesting developments that can be observed to be positive

##### include a rapid expansion of Renewable Energy Technology and Capacity.

##### As exciting as that is however, there is the fact that non-renewable fuels

##### will remain very present in our energy mix up until 2050. Moreover, there is

##### an observed hurdle awaiting us in the future related to emsissions growth.

##### It is forecasted that emissions from non-OECD countries is set to be double

##### that of OECD countries. This is bad news as it foreshadows a failure on OECD

##### countries to provide financial and technological support for emerging economies

##### related to energy use and production. Thus, overall, renewable technology is not

##### expected to growth at a fast enough pace given current energy policies in the US.

##### Lastly, energy use is expected to continue growing and at a consisten pace, meaning

##### that, given population growth and developing economy growth, the issue related

##### to energy consumption and emissions can be assumed to only continue to get bigger.
